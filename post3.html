      <h2>💬 Why I Started This Blog</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on May 16, 2025</em></p>

      <p>This blog began as a simple idea:a way to practice HTML and share my thoughts. But it's quickly become more than that. It’s a space where I can be honest, creative, and reflective.</p>

      <p>Sometimes writing helps me process what I’m learning. Other times, it helps me realize how much I’ve already grown. And if someone else finds encouragement through these words, that’s a bonus.</p>

      <p>So whether you’re here for tech tips or life thoughts — thank you for reading. This is just the beginning.</p>
