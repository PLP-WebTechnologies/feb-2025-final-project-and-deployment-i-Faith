      <h2>⏳ Growth Takes Time</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on May 15, 2025</em></p>

      <p>There are days when I feel like I’m not moving fast enough. Like everyone else is racing ahead while I’m still figuring things out. But then I pause, take a deep breath, and remind myself: growth takes time.</p>

      <p>Real growth isn’t loud. It’s the quiet progress that happens when no one is watching. It's the small wins: fixing a bug, understanding a new concept, or even just showing up to learn when you're tired.</p>

      <p>If you ever feel like giving up, look back at where you started. You’ll realize you’re already becoming who you wanted to be.</p>
