      <h2>ðŸŒ± Learning to Code</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on May 14, 2025</em></p>

      <p>My journey into coding began with pure curiosity. I didnâ€™t know what HTML or CSS meant, but I wanted to create something of my own.</p>
      <p>Each tag I learned and each little bug I fixed made me feel more confident. It's not always easy(but it's always worth it).</p>
      <p>This blog is a result of that journey ,Yes,a reminder to keep learning, keep trying, and keep building.</p>
